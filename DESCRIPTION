Description: Provides a unified framework for computing and analyzing Z-residuals across a diverse range of statistical models. The package facilitates model diagnostics by transforming outputs from popular modeling frameworks—including 'coxph', 'survreg', 'glmmTMB', and 'brms'—into standardized Z-residuals. These tools enable researchers to assess model fit, identify outliers, and detect misspecification. In addition to standard residuals, the package implements cross-validatory variants to support robust predictive assessments and model validation workflows.URL: https://tiw150.github.io/Zresidual
