<p>This vignette explains how to use the Zresidual package to calculate
Z-residuals based on the output of the coxph function from the survival
package in R. It also serves as a demonstration of how to use
Z-residuals to assess the overall goodness of fit (GOF) and identify
specific model misspecifications in semi-parametric shared frailty
models. To fully understand the detailed definitions and the example
data analysis results, please refer to the original paper titled
“Z-residual diagnostics for detecting misspecification of the functional
form of covariates for shared frailty models.</p>

under the true model . Therefore, the RSPs can be transformed into
residuals with any desired distribution. We prefer to transform them
with the normal quantile:

\end{equation}</annotation></semantics></math> which is normally
distributed under the true model, so that we can conduct model
diagnostics with Z-residuals for censored data in the same way as
conducting model diagnostics for a normal regression model. There are a
few advantages of transforming RSPs into Z-residuals. First, the
diagnostics methods for checking normal regression are rich in the
literature. Second, transforming RSPs into normal deviates facilitates
the identification of extremely small and large RSPs. The frequency of
such small RSPs may be too small to be highlighted by the plots of RSPs.
However, the presence of such extreme SPs, even very few, is indicative
of model misspecification. Normal transformation can highlight such
extreme RSPs.</p>

<p>This example provides a fundamental illustration of using the
Z-residuals for diagnosing both the overall goodness of fit (GOF) and
the functional form of covariates in a real application for modelling
the survival times of acute myeloid leukemia patients.</p>
<p>The dataset employed in our analysis contains 411 patients who were
recorded at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1996.
These patients were under the age of 60 and hailed from 24
administrative districts. The data collected information on the survival
time for acute myeloid leukemia and prognostic factors, including age,
sex, white blood cell count (wbc) at diagnosis, and the townsend score
(tpi) for which higher values indicate less affluent areas. The
censoring rate is 29.2%. The response variable of interest is the
survival time in days, which is the time from entry to the study or
death. The preliminary study showed that the wbc is highly right-skewed.
Logarithm transformation is often used to reduce the impact of extremely
large values of the covariate on the response variable, such as the wbc
variable in this application. However, a logarithm transformation may
mask the impact of extremely large values of the covariate on the
outcome variable.</p>

<p>Diagnosing the overall goodness-of-fit (GOF) using Z-residuals as
follows:</p>
<p>A QQ plot based on Z-residuals can be used to graphically assess the
model’s overall GOF, and Shapiro-Wilk (SW) or Shapiro-Francia (SF)
normality tests applied to Z-residuals can be used to numerically test
the overall GOF of the model. We can see that the QQ plots of
Z-residuals of these two models align well with the 45

where Z-SW is the test method that the normality of Z-residuals is
tested with the SW test.</p>

Figure 1: QQ plots of Z-residuals for the wbc (left panels) and lwbc
(right panels) models fitted to the survival data of acute myeloid
leukemia patients
</p>
</div>
<p>The Z-residuals can be divided into
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>k</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math>
groups by cutting the linear predictors or covariates into
equally-spaced intervals. Then we can check whether the Z-residuals of
the
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>k</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math>
groups are homogeneously distributed. A quantitative method to assess
the homogeneity of such grouped Z-residuals is to test the equality of
group means or variances of the Z-residuals. We employ the F-test in
ANOVA to assess the equality of means and Bartlett’s test to examine the
equality of variances.</p>
<p>The scatterplots of Z-residuals against the linear predictor don’t
exhibit visible trends; their LOWESS lines are very close to the
horizontal line at 0; the boxplots of Z-residuals grouped by cutting
linear predictors into equal-spaced intervals appear to have equal means
and variance across groups. The Z-AOV and Z-BL for linear predictors
tests also gives large p-values for the wbc and lwbc models, where Z-AOV
and Z-BL are the methods of applying ANOVA and Bartlett to test the
equality of the means and variances of Z-residuals against the groups
formed with the linear predictor.</p>
<p>Identifing specific model misspecifications using Z-residuals as
follows:</p>
<p>The above diagnostics results reveal no serious misspecification in
these two models. However, the inspection of the Z-residuals against the
covariate wbc/log(wbc) reveals that the functional form of the lwbc
model is likely misspecified. The scatterplots and comparative boxplots
of the Z-residuals against wbc/log(wbc) are shown below. The LOWESS
curve of the wbc model appears to align well with the horizontal line at
0 and the grouped Z-residuals of the wbc model appear to have equal
means and variances across groups. However, the diagnosis results for
the lwbc model are very different. It appears that there is a non-linear
trend in the LOWESS curve of the lwbc model and the grouped Z-residuals
appear to have different means across groups. The Z-AOV and Z-BL for
covariate wbc and log(wbc) also gives p-values for the wbc and lwbc
models as shown in the boxplots. The very small p-value of the Z-AOV for
covariate log(wbc) test for the lwbc models strongly suggests that the
log transformation of wbc is likely inappropriate for modelling the
survival time.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Shapiro-Wilk (SW) or Shapiro-Francia (SF) normality tests applied
to Z-residuals can be used to numerically test the overall GOF of the
model. Moreover, the Shapiro-Franciard (SF) test can be employed to
assess the normality of censored data. The diagnosis of the GOF of
survival probabilities can be converted into a diagnosis of the
normality of the censored Z-residuals. Thus, by utilizing the
gofTestCensored function from the R package EnvStats, one can examine
the normality of censored Z-residuals.</p>

<p>The martingale residuals are mostly within the interval (-3, 1) for
those two models. In the scatterplots of martingale residuals under the
wbc model, the LOWESS curves have a slight upward slope on the left,
while under the lwbc model, they display a pronounced downward curve.
Both of these lines demonstrate noticeable non-horizontal trends.</p>
