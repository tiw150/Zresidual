# Zresidual: Diagnostics with Z-residuals

Provides a unified framework for computing and analyzing Z-residuals
across a diverse range of statistical models. The package facilitates
model diagnostics by transforming outputs from popular modeling
frameworks—including 'coxph', 'survreg', 'glmmTMB', and 'brms'—into
standardized Z-residuals. These tools enable researchers to assess model
fit, identify outliers, and detect misspecification. In addition to
standard residuals, the package implements cross-validatory variants to
support robust predictive assessments and model validation
