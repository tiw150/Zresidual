  abstract  = "This paper explores the specification and testing of some
               modified count data models. These alternatives permit more
               flexible specification of the data-generating process (dgp) than
               do familiar count data models (e.g., the Poisson), and provide a
               natural means for modeling data that are over- or underdispersed
               by the standards of the basic models. In the cases considered,
               the familiar forms of the distributions result as
               parameter-restricted versions of the proposed modified
               distributions. Accordingly, score tests of the restrictions that
               use only the easily-computed ML estimates of the standard models
               are proposed. The tests proposed by Hausman (1978) and White
               (1982) are also considered. The tests are then applied to count
               data models estimated using survey microdata on beverage
               consumption.",
