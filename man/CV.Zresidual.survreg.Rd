\title{Cross-Validated Z-Residuals for Parametric Survival Regression Models}
\usage{
CV.Zresidual.survreg(fit.survreg, data, nfolds, foldlist, n.rep)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit.survreg}{A fitted parametric survival regression model from
\pkg{survival}, created using \code{\link[survival]{survreg}}.}

\item{data}{Optional \code{data.frame} used for cross-validation. It must
contain the survival response and all covariates appearing in
\code{fit.survreg$terms}. If \code{NULL}, the model frame of
\code{fit.survreg} (via \code{model.frame.survreg()}) is used internally.}

\item{nfolds}{Integer. Number of cross-validation folds. If \code{NULL},
the number of folds is chosen heuristically based on the number of
available cores, approximately as \code{10 \%/\%  ncores * ncores}.}

\item{foldlist}{Optional list specifying fold indices. Each element should
be an integer vector giving the row indices of the held-out (test) set
for a given fold. If \code{NULL}, folds are created using
\code{make_fold()}, stratifying by the survival response and censoring
indicator.}

\item{n.rep}{Integer. Number of repeated Z-residual samples per observation
in each fold (i.e. number of Monte Carlo replications for censored
observations in \code{Zresidual.survreg}).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{n \times} \code{n.rep}, where \eqn{n}
is the number of rows in \code{data} (if supplied) or in the internal
model frame of \code{fit.survreg}. Columns are named
\code{"CV.Z-residual 1"}, \code{"CV.Z-residual 2"}, \dots, up to
\code{n.rep}. The matrix has the following attributes attached:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"type"}: character string \code{"survival"}.
  \item \code{"Survival.Prob"}: vector of predicted survival probabilities
        at the observed time for each observation.
  \item \code{"linear.pred"}: vector of linear predictors on the
        \code{survreg} scale.
  \item \code{"censored.status"}: event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored).
  \item \code{"covariates"}: data frame of covariates used for the
        residual computation.
  \item \code{"object.model.frame"}: data frame representing the model
        frame underlying the CV residuals.
}

\description{
Computes cross-validated (CV) Z-residuals for a parametric survival
regression model fitted by \code{\link[survival]{survreg}}. The function
performs K-fold cross-validation, refits the \code{survreg} model on each
training subset, and computes Z-residuals on the held-out fold via
\code{Zresidual.survreg()}.
}
\details{
The function works in two modes:
\itemize{
  \item If \code{data} is not \code{NULL}, folds are defined on the rows
        of \code{data}. For each fold, the model is refitted on
        \code{data[-test, ]} and Z-residuals are computed on
        \code{data[test, ]}.
  \item If \code{data} is \code{NULL}, the internal model frame of
        \code{fit.survreg} is used. The function reconstructs explicit
        time and status columns from the \code{Surv} response before
        refitting the \code{survreg} model within each fold.
}

For each fold, \code{CV.Zresidual.survreg()} attempts to refit the model
using the same formula and distribution as in \code{fit.survreg}. If the
model fit fails (due to convergence or other errors/warnings), the
corresponding fold residuals are filled with \code{NA}.

The per-fold Z-residual matrices are then stacked into a single
\eqn{n \times} \code{n.rep} matrix, where \eqn{n} is the total number of
observations. Attributes such as survival probabilities, linear predictors,
censoring status, covariates, and the model frame are reassembled in the
original observation order.
