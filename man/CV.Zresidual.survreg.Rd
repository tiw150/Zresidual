\title{Cross-validated Z-residuals for parametric survival regression models}
\usage{
\method{CV.Zresidual}{survreg}(object, nfolds, foldlist = NULL, data = NULL, nrep = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted \code{survival::survreg} model object.}

\item{nfolds}{Integer. Number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{foldlist}{Optional list specifying custom fold assignments. If
\code{NULL}, folds are generated internally.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame used to refit the model during
cross-validation. Required when \code{foldlist} is supplied or when
the original model call does not contain the data explicitly.}

\item{nrep}{Integer. Number of repeated cross-validations to perform.
Default is 1.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the internal worker function.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"cvzresid"} containing cross-validated
Z-residual diagnostics for the parametric survival model.
}
\description{
S3 method for \code{CV.Zresidual()} applied to parametric survival
regression models fitted with \code{survival::survreg()}.
}
\details{
This method delegates the actual cross-validation work to
\code{CV_Zresidual_survreg_survival()}, which performs fold
construction, model refitting, and computation of cross-validated
Z-residuals.

The returned object is tagged with class \code{"cvzresid"} in addition
to any classes returned by the internal worker.
