\title{Cross-validated Z-residuals for parametric survival regression models}
\usage{
\method{CV.Zresidual}{survreg}(object, nfolds, foldlist = NULL, data = NULL, nrep = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted \code{\link[survival]{survreg}} model object.}

\item{nfolds}{Integer. Number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{foldlist}{Optional list specifying custom fold assignments. If
\code{NULL}, folds are generated internally, typically stratified by the
survival response and censoring indicator.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame used to refit the model during
cross-validation. It is \strong{highly recommended} to supply the original data
here to ensure correct model refitting in each fold, especially when the
original call was complex.}

\item{nrep}{Integer. Number of repeated Z-residual samples per observation
to generate. Defaults to \code{1}. Each replicate involves re-randomizing
the imputed survival probability for censored observations.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the internal worker function
\code{\link{CV_Zresidual_survreg_survival}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"cvzresid"} containing cross-validated
Z-residual diagnostics for the parametric survival model. It is a numeric
matrix with \eqn{N}{N} rows and \code{nrep} columns, accompanied by diagnostic attributes
(see \code{\link{CV_Zresidual_survreg_survival}} for details).
}
\description{
S3 method for \code{\link{CV.Zresidual}()} applied to parametric survival
regression models fitted with \code{\link[survival]{survreg}}. This method
performs K-fold cross-validation to obtain external Z-residuals for model
diagnostics.
}
\details{
This method delegates the actual cross-validation work to
\code{\link{CV_Zresidual_survreg_survival}}, which handles the iterative
refitting of the \code{survreg} model on \eqn{K-1}{K-1} folds and computes the
randomized Z-residuals on the held-out fold.

The randomized Z-residual, \eqn{Z_{ij}}{Z\_ij}, for the \eqn{j}{j}-th observation in the \eqn{i}{i}-th fold is defined as:
\deqn{Z_{ij} = ...}{Z\_ij = ...} is computed based on the predicted out-of-sample survival probability \eqn{\hat{S}_{\text{train}_i}(t_j)}{S_hat_i(t_j)}.

The returned object is tagged with class \code{"cvzresid"} in addition
to any classes returned by the internal worker.
