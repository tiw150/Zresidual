\title{Z-residuals for hurdle negative binomial models fitted with brms}
\usage{
\method{Zresidual}{hurdle_negbinomial.brms}(
  object,
  nrep = 1,
  data,
  type = c("hurdle", "count", "zero"),
  method = "iscv",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `brmsfit` object with hurdle negative binomial family
(`brms::family(object)$family == "hurdle_negbinomial"`).}

\item{nrep}{Integer; number of replicated Z-residual sets to generate.
Default is `1`.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame used for prediction or residual computation.
If \code{NULL}, the data stored inside the \code{brmsfit} object are used.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying which part of the model to
compute Z-residuals for:
\itemize{
  \item `"zero"`   — the hurdle/zero part;
  \item `"count"`  — the truncated negative binomial count part;
  \item `"hurdle"` — the full hurdle negative binomial model.
}
The default is `"hurdle"`.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the residual calculation method:
`"iscv"` for importance-sampled cross-validated randomized predictive
p-values, `"rpost"` for randomized posterior predictive p-values,
or `"mpost"` for middle-value posterior predictive p-values.
Default is `"iscv"`.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the underlying implementation
function [Zresidual_hurdle_negbinomial_brms()].}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of Z-residuals (one column per replication) as returned
by [Zresidual_hurdle_negbinomial_brms()], with the class `"zresid"`
added to its class vector.
}
\description{
`Zresidual.hurdle_negbinomial.brms()` is the S3 method for [Zresidual()]
when applied to hurdle negative binomial models fitted with [brms::brm()]
and `family = hurdle_negbinomial()`. Objects are dispatched here when
the fitted object is a `"brmsfit"` with
`brms::family(object)$family == "hurdle_negbinomial"` and has been
internally tagged with the class `"hurdle_negbinomial.brms"` by
[Zresidual()].

In normal use, users should call [Zresidual()] directly on the
`brmsfit` object (for example `Zresidual(fit)`), rather than calling
`Zresidual.hurdle_negbinomial.brms()` explicitly.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  library(brms)
  fit_hnb <- brm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df,
                 family = hurdle_negbinomial())

  ## Counts part only
  z_count <- Zresidual(fit_hnb, type = "count", method = "iscv")

  ## Full hurdle model with 2 replicates
  z_hurdle <- Zresidual(fit_hnb, type = "hurdle", nrep = 2)
}
