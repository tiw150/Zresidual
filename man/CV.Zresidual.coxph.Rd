\usage{
\method{CV.Zresidual}{coxph}(object, nfolds, foldlist = NULL, data = NULL, nrep = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted \code{survival::coxph} model object.}

\item{nfolds}{Integer. Number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{foldlist}{Optional list specifying custom fold assignments. If
\code{NULL}, folds are generated internally.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame used to refit the model during
cross-validation. Required when \code{foldlist} is supplied or when
the original model call does not contain the data explicitly.}

\item{nrep}{Integer. Number of repeated cross-validations to perform.
Default is 1.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the internal worker functions.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"cvzresid"} containing cross-validated
Z-residual diagnostics for the Cox model.
}
\description{
S3 method for \code{CV.Zresidual()} applied to Cox proportional
hazards models fitted with \code{survival::coxph()}. The method
automatically detects whether a frailty term is present in the model
formula and dispatches to internal implementations for standard Cox
models and shared frailty Cox models.
}
\details{
Depending on the presence of a frailty term such as
\code{frailty(group)} in \code{object$terms}, the method calls:
\itemize{
  \item \code{CV_Zresidual_coxph_survival()} for standard Cox models;
  \item \code{CV_Zresidual_coxph_frailty_survival()} for shared frailty
        Cox models.
}

The returned object is tagged with class \code{"cvzresid"} in addition
to any classes returned by the internal worker.
