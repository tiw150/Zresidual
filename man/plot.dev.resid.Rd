\title{Plot deviance residuals for survival models}
\usage{
\method{plot}{dev.resid}(
  Deviance.residual,
  ylab = "Deviance Residual",
  X = c("index", "lp", "covariate"),
  main.title = "Deviance Residual Plot",
  outlier.return = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Deviance.residual}{Numeric vector (or one-column matrix) of deviance
residuals, typically returned by one of the residual functions in this
package with \code{residual.type = "deviance"}. It must carry the
attributes \code{"censored.status"}, \code{"linear.pred"}, and
\code{"covariates"} as described above.}

\item{ylab}{Character string for the y-axis label. Default is
\code{"Deviance Residual"}.}

\item{X}{Character string controlling the x-axis. Must be one of
\code{"index"}, \code{"lp"}, \code{"covariate"}, or the name of a
covariate contained in \code{attr(Deviance.residual, "covariates")}.
The default is effectively \code{"lp"} if \code{X} is not supplied.}

\item{main.title}{Character string for the main plot title. Default is
\code{"Deviance Residual Plot"}.}

\item{outlier.return}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, attempted outliers (as
indicated by an external logical vector \code{is.outlier} in the calling
environment) are highlighted in the plot and their indices are returned
invisibly. If \code{FALSE} (default), no outlier indices are returned.
Note that this function does not compute outliers internally: it assumes
that a logical vector \code{is.outlier} of the same length as
\code{Deviance.residual} is available if outlier highlighting is desired.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying plotting functions.}
}
\value{
The function is primarily called for its side-effect of producing a plot.
If \code{outlier.return = TRUE}, it prints the indices of outlying points
to the console and invisibly returns a list with component
\code{outliers}, containing the indices where \code{is.outlier} is
\code{TRUE}. Otherwise, it returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
Produce diagnostic plots for deviance residuals from survival models,
with the option to plot against the observation index, the linear
predictor, or a selected covariate. The function expects a vector (or
one-column matrix) of deviance residuals with attributes attached by
the residual computation functions in this package.
}
\details{
The input \code{Deviance.residual} is typically obtained from
\code{residual.coxph()}, \code{residual.coxph.frailty()}, or
\code{residual.survreg()} with \code{residual.type = "deviance"}.

The \code{X} argument controls the x-axis:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"index"}: plot deviance residuals against observation index.
  \item \code{"lp"}: plot deviance residuals against the linear predictor
        (attribute \code{"linear.pred"}).
  \item \code{"covariate"}: prompt the user and print the available
        covariate names to the console.
  \item a character string matching one of the covariate names in
        \code{attr(Deviance.residual, "covariates")}: plot deviance
        residuals against that covariate.
}

In the \code{"lp"} and covariate cases, a LOWESS smooth is added to the
plot to highlight systematic patterns in the residuals.

Non-finite deviance residuals are detected and truncated to lie slightly
beyond the largest finite residual, with a message printed to alert the
user that there may be problems with the model fit. Censored and
uncensored observations are distinguished by color and plotting symbol
in all display modes.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  library(survival)

  data(lung)
  fit <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex, data = lung)
  r_d <- residual.coxph(fit, newdata = lung,
                        residual.type = "deviance")

  ## Basic plot vs. index
  plot.dev.resid(r_d, X = "index")

  ## Plot vs. linear predictor
  plot.dev.resid(r_d, X = "lp")

  ## Plot vs. a specific covariate, e.g. "age"
  plot.dev.resid(r_d, X = "age")
