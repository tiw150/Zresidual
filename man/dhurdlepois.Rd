\title{Probability Mass Function of the Hurdle Poisson Distribution}
\usage{
dhurdlepois(y, lambda, pi, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector of observed counts.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric vector of Poisson mean parameters (must be positive).}

\item{pi}{Numeric vector of hurdle probabilities (probability of structural zeros),
where each value must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{log}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, probabilities are returned on the log scale.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{y}, giving the density (or log-density)
of the Poisson hurdle distribution.
}
\description{
Computes the probability density (or log-density) for the Poisson hurdle distribution.
This distribution combines a point mass at zero with a truncated-at-zero Poisson
distribution for positive counts.
}
\details{
The hurdle Poisson distribution assumes:
\deqn{
P(Y = 0) = \pi
}
and for \eqn{y > 0}:
\deqn{
P(Y = y) = (1 - \pi) \frac{P_{\text{Pois}}(Y = y)}{1 - P_{\text{Pois}}(Y = 0)}
}
where \eqn{P_{\text{Pois}}(Y = y)} is the standard Poisson probability mass function.

The function is vectorized over all parameters.

\examples{
# Example usage:
y <- 0:5
lambda <- 2
pi <- 0.3
dhurdlepois(y, lambda, pi)
dhurdlepois(y, lambda, pi, log = TRUE)
