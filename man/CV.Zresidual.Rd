\title{Cross-validated Z-residual diagnostics (generic)}
\usage{
CV.Zresidual(object, nfolds, foldlist = NULL, data = NULL, nrep = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object.}

\item{nfolds}{Integer. Number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{foldlist}{Optional list specifying custom fold assignments. If
\code{NULL}, folds are generated internally by the method.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame used to refit the model during
cross-validation, when required by the method.}

\item{nrep}{Integer. Number of repeated cross-validations to perform.
Default is 1.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed on to specific methods.}
}
\value{
An object whose structure depends on the underlying method, typically
tagged with class \code{"cvzresid"} in addition to method-specific
classes.
}
\description{
Generic function for cross-validated Z-residual diagnostics.
Method dispatch is based on the class of \code{object}. Methods are
currently provided for survival models such as \code{coxph} and
\code{survreg}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  library(survival)
  fit <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex, data = lung)
  out <- CV.Zresidual(fit, nfolds = 5, data = lung)
}
