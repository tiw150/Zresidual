\title{Z-residuals for parametric survival regression models (survival)}
\usage{
\method{Zresidual}{survreg.survival}(object, nrep = 1, data = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted [survival::survreg()] model.}

\item{nrep}{Integer; number of randomized Z-residual replicates to
generate. Defaults to `1`.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame containing the survival response and
covariates; if `NULL`, the original model frame is used.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored; included for method compatibility.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{n \times} \code{nrep}, with
additional attributes as produced by `Zresidual_survreg_survival()`. The
returned object is given class `"zresid"` in addition to any
existing classes.
}
\description{
S3 method for [Zresidual()] when the fitted model is a
[survival::survreg()] object (internally tagged as `"survreg.survival"`).
This is a thin wrapper around the existing `Zresidual.survreg()` core
implementation: it simply passes the fitted object and optional `data`
to the core function and then adds the `"zresid"` class.

Users are expected to call [Zresidual()] directly rather than calling
`Zresidual.survreg.survival()`.
